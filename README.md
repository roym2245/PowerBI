# Breakdown of Survey Analysis Project using Power BI

### Data Cleaning
  Import survey data into Power BI from various sources (e.g., Excel, CSV, database).
  #### Perform data cleaning tasks:
  Empty columns.
  Ensure consistency in formatting.
  #### Transform the data:
  Create calculated columns or measures.

  ### Data Visualization
  #### Explore survey results through visualizations:
  Choose appropriate visualization types (e.g., bar charts, line charts, pie charts).
  Group and filter data to analyze specific segments or trends.
            Utilize color, size, and visual cues effectively.
        Incorporate interactivity:
            Slicers, filters, drill-throughs.
            Enable dynamic exploration of data.

  #### Dashboard Creation
  Combine visualizations into a cohesive dashboard:
            Arrange visualizations logically and aesthetically.
            Include titles, subtitles, annotations for context.
        Add interactivity:
            Enable user interaction with data.
            Incorporate KPIs, trend analysis, geographic mapping as needed.
        Ensure user-friendliness:
            Intuitive navigation.
            Clear presentation of information.

#### Throughout the project:
Utilize Power BI's tools for comprehensive survey data analysis.
